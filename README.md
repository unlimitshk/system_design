my rather cute attempts at solving system design problems :)

# Framework to solving System Design problems

- You are asked to design X system (i.e. for example, Design TikTok)
- Pause for a minute, think about it and come up with clarifying questions to open up the design scope.
- For example, you could ask:
  - "I'm not familiar with this system, can you describe it?"
  - "What should we focus on?"
  - "What are the use cases in scope for this interview?"
- Start writing, whether on a sheet of paper or the interactive whiteboard shared by your interviewer.
- (**_Non functional requirements_**) Outline a high level representation of the system, focus on metrics at first, and practice multiplying and dividing big numbers beforehand:
  - "What's the scale you have in mind for this interview?"
  - "Think about the number of users you are tageting"
  - "Think about the daily active users to account for"
  - "Think about the number of videos you are expecting to store"
  - "Think about how many videos are viewed per day, per second. What about peak times?"
  - "Think about how many videos are uploaded and downloaded per day"
  - "What's the average video length? Size? Metadata (ID, Likes, Comments, Description, etc.)"
- Make sure the interviewer is onboard with your approach and assumptions. An example could be that you want to skip the login part as it is quite standard, and also want to focus on the backend rather than the frontend (app).
- (**_High level design_**) Draw out a high level representation of the main components of your system.
